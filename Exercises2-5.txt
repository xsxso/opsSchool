1. Ran the command route and saw a rogue entry which I deleted by using 

     route del 208.86.224.90
    
2. Ran the command 

     sudo nano /etc/hosts

   I deleted the entry 

     127.0.0.1 ascii-art.de 

   that was preventing me from connecting.
   
3. Inside of /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default

   under the configuration for /var/www/ I removed the *deny from all* entry, 
   where I understood the final config should look like this:

      <Directory /var/www/>
         Options Indexes FollowSymLinks Includes ExecCGI
         AllowOverride All
         Allow from all
      </Directory>

4. On server1 went into /etc/hosts/ and added the line 
	
	192.168.100.11 server2

   On server2 went into /etc/hosts/ and added the line 

	192.168.100.10 server1 

   created a password on both servers using passwd while logged in as root

5. First went into /etc/ssh/sshd_config and set *PasswordAuthentication* to no

     ran service ssh restart

     ran ssh-keygen

     on server1 ssh-copy-id root@server2

     on server2 ssh-copy-id root@server1
