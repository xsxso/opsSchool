Dear Yaron, 

I was able to complete the homework assignment but noticed towards the end that all 
of the actions to be performed have to be shell scripts. 

As I do not want to create the false impression that I know how to write 
anything but the most basic shell scripts, I've chosen to only make the first file into a shell script. 

The other solutions I have shared within the above text file. 

I hope this doesn't disqualify me from the program, as I've learned a lot during this 
assignment and would certainly like to continue to the December session with the enterprise.  

Eli.
