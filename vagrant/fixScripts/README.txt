Dear opsSchool team, 

I was able to complete the homework assignment but noticed towards the end that all of the actions to be performed have to be delivered as shell scripts.

I do not want to create the false impression that I know how to write anything but the most basic shell script, I've chosen to only make the first file into a shell script. 

The other solutions I have shared within a txt file. 

I've learned a lot during this assignment and would certainly like to continue to the December session with the enterprise.  

Eli.
